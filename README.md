# Coral Restoration Project

This project is created by Group 7 of ITSC 4155-001 capstone course at UNC Charlotte. 
This capstone project is to explore coral reef analysis through a mobile application. 
This application helps to ensure users have an easy way to enter specific data during field work and visualize that data.



## Getting Started

This project uses the Gradle-based build system. 
To build this project, we used an emulator provided by [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

Please clone this github repository using git clone to your desired location.

```bash
cd <desired_location>
git clone https://github.com/jhall1520/capstoneProject

To emulate application:

- Click `Create device`
- Navigate to `Pixel 4` on the "Choose a device definition" table and click `Next`.
- Download the `Q` system image (this may take a while) and click next.
