# Coral Restoration Project

This project is created by Group 7 of ITSC 4155-001 capstone course at UNC Charlotte. 
This capstone project is to explore coral reef analysis through a mobile application. 
This application helps to ensure users have an easy way to enter specific data during field work and visualize that data.



## Getting Started

This project uses the Gradle-based build system. 
To build this project, we used an emulator provided by [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

Please clone this github repository using git clone to your desired location.

```bash
cd <desired_location>
git clone https://github.com/jhall1520/capstoneProject
```

Android Studio IDE setup and Emulation Setup

For development and emulation, the latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) is required. 

To open the project:
- Close project by `File > Close Project` if another project is open.
- Click `Open` in the "Welcome to Android Studio" window and navigate to `capstoneProject > coralReefProject` and click `OK`.

To emulate application:
- At the top right of the IDE, click on `Device Manager` (the one that looks like a phone with the android logo).
- Click `Create device`
- Navigate to `Pixel 4` on the "Choose a device definition" table and click `Next`.
- Download the `Q` system image (this may take a while) and click next.
- Have everything to default for "Verify Configuration" and click `Finish`.
- At the top layout bar or next to your Pixel 4 virtual device, click the green play button to launch emulation.
- If you choose to enlarge the emulation, minimize the "Device Manager" window.
